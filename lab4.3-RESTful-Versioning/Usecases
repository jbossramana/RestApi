There are four common strategies for REST API versioning, each with specific real-world use cases 
where they shine:

1. URI Versioning (Path Versioning)

Description: Includes the version number directly in the API's Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) path 
(e.g., /api/**v1**/users).

Real-world Usecases:

Public-facing APIs (Web/Mobile Apps): This is the most common and often preferred method for 
APIs consumed by third parties or client applications like mobile apps.

Why: It's simple, discoverable, and easily handled by tools like API gateways and load balancers 
for routing. Clients can clearly see and hardcode which version they are calling.

Major Breaking Changes: Used when a change is so fundamental (e.g., complete endpoint restructure, 
major data model change) that older clients must be aware they are calling a different API.

Example: Moving from a monolithic user data model (/v1/users) to a segmented one (/v2/user-profiles 
and /v2/user-settings).


2. Request Parameter Versioning (Query String Versioning)

Description: Appends the version number as a query parameter to the URI (e.g., /api/users?**version=1**).

Real-world Usecases:

Minor Non-Breaking Changes/Defaulting: Useful for introducing minor, additive, or behavioral changes
that don't fundamentally break existing clients.

Why: If the parameter is omitted, the API can default to the latest stable version, allowing older clients 
to continue working without modification. New clients can opt into the new features.

Testing and Internal APIs: Sometimes used internally for quick, easy testing of new features or versions 
without changing the core URI structure.

Example: Adding an optional new field to a response, where a client can request ?version=2 to see the 
new field, but existing clients requesting ?version=1 or no version get the old response format.

3. (Custom) Headers Versioning

Description: Passes the version number in a custom request header (e.g., X-API-Version: 1).

Real-world Usecases:

Client Flexibility & Clean URIs: Preferred when you want to keep the URI clean and stable across 
versions, as the versioning metadata is moved to the header.

Why: Useful in environments where the URI path is critical for internal routing or monitoring, 
and you don't want the version number cluttering it.

Internal Service-to-Service Communication (Microservices): Commonly used for internal services 
where the contract is well-known.

Example: A payment processing service calls an internal authentication service. The payment service 
can specify the version of the authentication API it expects via a header, keeping the authentication 
endpoint URI stable.


4. Media Type Versioning ("Content Negotiation" or "Accept Header")

Description: Includes the version number within the Accept header's media type 
(e.g., Accept: application/vnd.company.app.v2+json).

Real-world Usecases:

Hypermedia APIs (HATEOAS): The most RESTful approach, closely aligning with standard HTTP
 content negotiation principles.

Why: It treats different versions as different representations of the same resource, which is 
ideal for hypermedia where the resource is the URI.

High-Volume/External APIs Requiring Strict Protocol: Used by major tech companies (like GitHub or Stripe)
 for robust, long-term API strategies where the format of the response is a core part of the API contract.

Example: A GET /users/123 request could return:

Version 1 data with Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json (as GitHub does).

Version 2 data with Accept: application/vnd.github.v4+json.

The resource itself (/users/123) remains consistent, and the client specifies the exact representation 
it is able to process.
