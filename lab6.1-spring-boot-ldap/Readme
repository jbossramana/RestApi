1. DC = Domain Component (LDAP & Domain Names)

This is the meaning used in the configuration string: ldap://localhost:8389/dc=springframework,dc=org

In LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) and Distinguished Names (DNs), dc stands for 
Domain Component.

Purpose: It is used to construct the hierarchical path (the DN) that corresponds to an Internet 
Domain Name.

Example:

The domain name springframework.org is split into two components: springframework and org.

This translates in LDAP to the base DN: dc=springframework,dc=org.

This base DN represents the root of the directory tree for that domain.



.userDnPatterns("uid={0},ou=people")	

This specifies the pattern used to locate a user's 
Distinguished Name (DN).	When a user attempts to log in with a username (e.g., "bob"), 
Spring replaces {0} with "bob" and attempts to bind (authenticate) directly as that full 
DN: uid=bob,ou=people,dc=springframework,dc=org.

.groupSearchBase("ou=groups")	

Defines the base DN from which Spring will search for the 
user's group memberships. This is an optional feature. Spring will search within the
 ou=groups,dc=springframework,dc=org context to determine which groups the authenticated 
 user belongs to for authorization (e.g., roles).
